FLOYD-WARSHALL ALGORITHM:

 -  Finding shortest path in the graph
 -  shortest path between all pairs of vertices, negative edges allowed

Pseudo code

let v = number of vertices in graph
let dist = V*V array of minimum distance
for each vertex v
  dist[v][v] <- 0
for each edge (u, v)
  dist[u][v] <- weight(u, v)
for k from 1 to v
  for i from 1 to v
    for j from 1 to v
      if dist[i][j] > dist[i][k] + dist[k][j]
	dist[i][j] <- dist[i][k] + dist[k][j]		 
      end if
