1) DOM and Virtual DOM
2) Functional and Class Components
3) Passing Parameters Without Props and with Props
4) Using Props in Functional

State Management
----------------
props are used to transfer data from 1 component to another component
props are immutable

state is pre-defined, we just need to use
construct is best place to initialize state

state holds data inside a component
use constructor to create a state
use super() to make a request to parent(React) for state
to access we use this.state in an object
setState(command) is used to change the value of the state

JSON.stringify ==> should be used for displaying boolean values since react does not directly display them so we need to convert bools to strings

Assignment:
in StateEx component :
(Using State and Props combinedly)create another component StatePrint and receive data using props fron StateEx and then print the details in StatePrint

REDUX:

-> It is a third party library 
-> Used for state management

Terminologies and meanings 

-> Store == entire container
-> Reducer == logic performing on data
-> Dispatch == sending request from client to server
-> Subscribe == receive the data from client
-> Dispatch request is taken by reducer and reducer performs the request and updates the data

npm install redux --save ==> command to install redux

//we should create dummy state, ans should not alter original state


npm install -g create-react-app
ccreate-react-app react-redx-app
npm install redux react-redux --save

MIDDLEWARE

-> traps the request/actions which are dispatched already before reaching to reducer
-> when action is performed it captures that action and verifies the action
-> if the action is performed without any errors then it is updated in the store otherwise it is not updated in the store

-> we use (apply middleware)


SPA (routing)

-> Single Page Apllication
-> loading one component into another component without reloading the entire page
-> In react "react-router-dom" module is used to implement SPA
-> npm install react-router-dom --save  ==> to install react-router-dom module
